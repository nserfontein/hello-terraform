How to contribute
=================

All kinds of contributions are welcome. In particular I'd like to see the following

* Translation of more AWS code samples to Google Cloud Platform.
* Cover more cloud providers.
* Bug reports (on the Github Issues page).
* Better documentation.
* Feedback, suggestions, ideas, etc.
* Automatic testing of code samples (how????) possibly against different
  versions of Terraform.
* Chocolate.

Git and Github
--------------

First of all, you need to fork this repository. Then
clone your fork and create a branch for your changes. Personally
I use [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) which makes
`develop` the main development branch. You don't have to use
[gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) yourself but any
Pull requests on Github must be made against the `develop` branch.

The `master` branch always contains the latest "release" but is
otherwise static. In the context of this project a "release"
is simply a snapshot of this project.
